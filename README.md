## Foldvis

Protein visualization without the pain. `Foldvis` currently supports `jupyter notebook`-based exploration of:

- alignment of protein structures
- color by label (pLDDT, N to C terminus)
- display `AlphaFold2` model variance
- load and display variation from a multiple sequence alignment

The awesome `Anvio` has a [structure module](https://merenlab.org/2018/09/04/getting-started-with-anvio-structure/), should you be dissatisfied with `Foldvis`. However, I wanted a more lightweight tool, which to my knowledge did not exist, so I made one. PRs and suggestions welcome (also see TODOs)!

### Usage

Run the code below in a Jupyter notebook for the structures to render (`jupyter notebook example.ipynb`).

We will explore the protein structure of the full-length `ompA` gene of [Chlamydiifrater volucris](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Chlamydiifrater+volucris). It has 6 more (truncated) homologs of that gene in its genome. We are interested here in the variation amongst these copies.

We already used `AlphaFold2` to fold `OmpA` using the awesome `ColabFold` ([code](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold), [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.15.456425v3)) and saved the data under `data/full`


```python
import numpy as np

from foldvis.io import load_conserved
from foldvis.models import Fold, AlphaFold
from foldvis.vis import *  # yes I know, whatever


# Load alphafold model
af = AlphaFold('data/full')
# Pick the best model out of the 5 predictions
model = af.models[1]


# Load a PDB structure model
ref = Fold('data/1BXW.pdb')
# Align proteins and transform the query into the coordinate space of the target
tm, aln = ref.align_to(model, mode=2, minscore=0.3)
print(f'TM-score: {tm}')
# params passed to foldseek, see "foldseek search -h"
aln.rename_chains_({'A': 'B'})


# How does the structure we predict compare to experimentally validated ones?
view = plot_superposition([model, aln], {'A': 'grey', 'B': 'yellow'})
view.show()
```


<p align="center">
    <img src="img/overlay.png" width="350">
</p>


```python
# How certain is the AlphaFold2 of its prediction?
print(f"pLDDT for best model is {round(np.mean(model.annotation['plddt']), 2)}")
# Aim for > 50 seems ok

# Overlay the 5 models AlphaFold2 generates to assess model variation
view = plot_alphafold(af)
view.show()
```


<p align="center">
    <img src="img/alphafold.png" width="350">
</p>


```python
# We can color properties of the residues in our structure.
# What is available out of the box?
print(f'Available annotations: {list(model.annotation.keys())}')

# Color protein from N (violet) to C terminus (red)
# Colormaps are from matplotlib: 
# https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html
view = plot_annotation(model, label='position', palette='rainbow')
view.show()
```

```python
# Generate an MSA, e.g. here we used MAFFT
# linsi data/Cfvo_O50_ompA.fa > data/msa.faa"
fp = 'data/msa.faa'
ref = 'PPFHKHLK_00058 porin [the longest copy, i.e. the actual ompA]'

model.annotate_('variation', [1-i for i in load_conserved(fp, ref)])
view = plot_annotation(model, 'variation', 'viridis')
view.show()
```

### Advanced usage

A really cool idea is to map those parts of Pfam domains that are known (experimentally validated) to interact with ligands (ions, peptides, DNA, ...) to protein sequence and then see what spatial pattern this corresponds to when the sequence is folded into three dimensions:

- https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/2/582/5232439
- https://merenlab.org/2020/07/22/interacdome/
- https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.02.482602v1

You can now do this in `foldvis` with little effort. To illustrate, let's mark all residues that are involved in the binding of zinc ions in the zinc finger protein (which binds three zinc atoms); see also `example_ligands.ipynb`:

```python
from foldvis.models import AlphaFold, Binding
from foldvis.vis import *

# TODO: Adjust file path
fp = 'data/Pfam-A.hmm'

# Load best zinc finger model from AF2 prediction
af = AlphaFold('data/1AAY_alphafold')
best = af.models[1]

# Search bindin domains and align them to protein
b = Binding(best, 'confident')
b.predict_binding_(fp)

# What domains have been found? Which ligands can be visualized?
b.domains
b.ligands

# Map binding frequencies to protein
bf = b.get_binding('PF00096.25', 'ZN')
best.annotate_('bf', bf)

view = plot_annotation(best, 'bf', palette='viridis', surface=True, opacity=1.)
view.show()
```
